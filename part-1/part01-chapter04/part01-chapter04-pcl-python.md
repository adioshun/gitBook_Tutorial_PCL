First filter is the PCL’s Statistical Outlier Removal filter. in this filter for each point in the point cloud, it computes the distance to all of its neighbors, and then calculates a mean distance. By assuming a Gaussian distribution, all points whose mean distances are outside of an interval defined by the global distances mean+standard deviation are considered to be outliers and removed from the point cloud.

> 현재 Radius based 방식은 정상 동작 하지 않는다고 합니다. 파라미터를 바꾸어도 결과가 '0'이라고 하네요. [\[참고\]](https://github.com/strawlab/python-pcl/issues/211) - 2018.06.11
